<h2 id="toc_1">Teaching math for social justice &amp; vice versa</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">How does math relate to social justice?</h3>

<p>Even though it might not always be immediately clear, there are a few ways math can be crucial to social justice. </p>

<p><strong>Thinking concretely</strong>, communities can use math, particularly data collection and analysis, to describe issues they are dealing with, to recognize disparities, and to find changes over time and space. This might include using data to debunk stereotypes, evaluate the strength or weakness of programs, or map assets or issues. Often, data can confirm an issue that people have experienced, but that isn&#39;t believed until there is statistical evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking abstractly</strong>, math is more than learning rules and computations--organizers&#39; work is enhanced by skills in logic, problem solving, identifying patterns, and other forms of critical thinking.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">How does social justice relate to math?</h3>

<p>There are stark achievement/opportunity gaps in math and many related fields. In higher education, STEM fields often lack representation from women, people of color, first-generation students, and other marginalized groups. Likewise, low-income youth and youth of color are more likely to attend K-12 schools that don&#39;t offer computer literacy or computer science, advanced math and science classes, or other pathways to STEM fields. Many <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all">national initiatives</a> work to diversify these fields, but are still too few and far between. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.teachhub.com/ed-tech-closing-digital-divide">gaps in technology skills</a> are <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/06/neuman_celano_library_study_educational_technology_worsens_achievement_gaps.single.html">widening</a>, and not necessarily solved by efforts like 1:1 classroom programs.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Quick hits in the news</h3>

<p>A few examples of overlaps between math &amp; social justice that are currently or recently in the news (Jan. 2016):</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead poisoning crisis in Flint, MI: One way that the extent of the water crisis was kept from the public was through testing of water samples that broke scientific protocol and in turn--either through intentional sabotage or gross negligence--got back <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-went-wrong-in-flint-water-crisis-michigan/">drastically skewed results</a>. See more on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/15/this-is-how-toxic-flints-water-really-is/">water testing in Flint</a> and related <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/27/its-not-just-flint-poor-communities-across-the-country-live-with-extreme-polluters/">environmental justice studies</a>.</li>
<li>Widening income inequality in cities &amp; metro areas since before the recession, via a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2016/01/14-income-inequality-cities-update-berube-holmes">Brookings Institution study</a>. Spoiler: New Haven is #1 in the country in increased gaps between the 20th and 95th percentile incomes.</li>
<li>Two studies that confirm Black conventional wisdom: Black drivers in <a href="http://www.ctdatahaven.org/blog/connecticut-data-reveal-racial-disparities-policing">Connecticut</a> are more likely to be pulled over and searched, while being less likely to have illegal contraband (also see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html">a NYT feature</a> that includes Connecticut data). And Black workers really do have to be twice as good to get half as much, as the saying goes, and those pitfalls accumulate to create <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/why-black-workers-really-do-need-to-be-twice-as-good/409276/">wealth gaps</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">Examples &amp; exercises</h2>

<p>Even without a strong background in statistics, organizers can make use of data to understand some basic concepts in their work. Many of these concepts span multiple math classes.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Meta questions:</h3>

<p>Sometimes the most important question to ask about a data project is: <strong>Why is there no data?</strong> A very prominent example of this recently is the fact that no federal body in the US requires police departments to report use of force incidents, even when an officer has killed a civilian while on duty. In 2015, responding to the Black Lives Matter movement, both <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings">The Guardian</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/">Washington Post</a> launched databases where they crowdsourced and combed news reports of killings by police officers (there are also several similar projects run by <a href="http://killedbypolice.net/">individuals</a> and one by the <a href="http://www.policemisconduct.net/">Cato Institute</a>); by the end of the year, both the FBI and Dept. of Justice had to admit to their embarrassment at failing to collect any such data, and announced plans to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/05/justice-department-trials-system-count-killings-us-law-enforcement-the-counted">build a similar database</a> starting in the next few months.</p>

<p>Another example comes from organizing for transgender people&#39;s rights and safety. Similarly combing through news articles, advocates began counting homicides of trans people in the US and found <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/hes-not-done-killing-her-why-so-many-trans-women-were-murdered-in-2015">at least 23 trans women</a>, almost all women of color, who had been killed in 2015. Because there is no census or other government survey to document this, the trans community began documenting these alarming murders themselves.</p>

<p>It is also important to ask who is collecting data, who has access to that data, and who has the skills to make them data literate. We often see researchers studying inner-city communities in order to publish their own research, but the benefits of their research may, at best, trickle down to the people actually being studied. A different model, <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en">participatory action research</a>, sees the importance of communities being empowered and developing skills, not just serving as research subjects, through open use of data.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">General questions to ask:</h3>

<p>Once you have an issue in mind, investigate it with the 5 W&#39;s: who? what? when? where? why? and how?</p>

<p>Here are some questions to start with, but there are infinitely more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who does this affect? Who does this affect the <em>most</em>? How much more does this affect one group compared to others?</li>
<li>How has this changed over time? How have <em>rates</em> changed over time? How does this accumulate? (Note that questions like this, with real world examples, can help introduce calculus concepts.)</li>
<li>What is the context in which this happens? Political, social, economic, etc.</li>
<li>Where does this happen? Where does this happen the <em>most</em>? What are the conditions where this happens most?</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between two related occurrences? Remember that correlation does not imply causation!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">Exercise 1: Unemployment &amp; income</h3>

<p>In this exercise, we&#39;ll look at unemployment rates over time, as well as measures of income over time.</p>

<ol>
<li>This graph of unemployment rates in the US over time has an unlabeled x-axis. See if you can identify the start of the Great Recession, and take note of the unemployment rate at that time.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_9">Exercise 2: Juvenile justice</h3>

<h3 id="toc_10">Exercise 3: Police violence</h3>

<li><a href="http://equality-of-opportunity.org/index.php/data">Equality of Opportunity Project</a> from Harvard: beware that there are a lot of datasets here, and you&#39;ll need to Read Me&#39;s for each one to understand what the variables are. See a write-up on the project <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rich-kids-stay-rich-poor-kids-stay-poor/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_12">Last words of advice</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Read</strong> a lot! When you read a news article about a study, find the researcher&#39;s documentation. This is more and more available as researchers put their work, methodology, and even their data online and openly available.</li>
<li>Ask a lot of <strong>questions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust your students</strong>--something they&#39;re telling you about that you don&#39;t experience might still be true, and someday there might be data to back them up. See the racial profiling study above, which basically provides numerical evidence of what people of color have been saying for eons.</li>
<li><strong>Never ever ever tell a young person any variation of &quot;I&#39;m just not a math person&quot;</strong> or &quot;I just don&#39;t do math&quot;--especially don&#39;t do this in front of young women or students of color, or other students that are underrepresented in math &amp; science. Think about the message that sends them, and imagine being allowed to say, &quot;I just don&#39;t read&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t need to know about history.&quot;</li>
</ol>
